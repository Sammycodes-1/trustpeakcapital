                        <ul class="mt-4 list-dotted mb-4">
                           <li>Each joint Account holder will be jointly and severally liable for all obligations to EM arising in respect of your joint trading Account.</li>
                           <li>Each of you is separately responsible for complying with the terms of this Agreement.</li>
                           <li>If there is a dispute between you which we know about, we may insist that both or all of you authorize written instructions to us.</li>

                        <p>Where you provide personal and financial information relating to other joint Account holders for the purpose of opening or administering your trading Account you confirm that you have their consent or are otherwise entitled to provide this information to us and for us to use it in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Any of you may request closure and the redirection of balances, unless there are circumstances that require us to obtain authorization from all of you.</p>
                        <p>Each of you will be given sole access to the funds initially deposited by you in your joint trading Account. Should you wish to withdraw these funds from your trading Account, you will be required to complete and sign a withdrawal form, upon receipt of the completed and signed withdrawal form you will be granted permission by EM to withdraw funds up to the amount you initially deposited, provided that the conditions for withdrawals stipulated in clause 9 are satisfied.

                     <li>
                        <p><strong>PLACING OF INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
                        <p>You may give us instructions in electronic form through the EM Online Trading System or orally by telephone to the EM Trading Desk; unless we tell you that instructions can only be given in a particular way. If you give instructions by telephone, your conversation will be recorded. If any instructions are received by us by telephone, computer or other medium we may ask you to confirm such instructions in writing. We shall be authorized to follow instructions notwithstanding your failure to confirm them in writing. In this Agreement “instructions” and “orders” have the same meaning.</p>

                     <li>
                        <p><strong>TYPES OF ORDERS ACCEPTED</strong></p>
                        <p>Some of the types of Orders EM accepts include, but are not limited to:</p>
                        <ul class="mt-4 mb-4 list-dotted">
                           <li>Good till Cancelled (“GTC”) – An Order (other than a Market Order), that by its terms is effective until filled or cancelled by Customer. GTC Orders do not automatically cancel at the end of the Business Day on which they are placed.</li>
                           <li>Limit – An Order (other than a Market Order) to buy or sell the identified market at a specified price. A Limit Order to buy generally will be executed when the Ask Price equals or falls below the Bid Price that you specify in the Limit Order. A Limit Order to sell generally will be executed when the Bid Price equals or exceeds the Ask Price that you specify in the Limit Order.</li>
                           <li>Market – An Order to buy or sell the identified market at the current market price that EM provides either via the Online Trading System or over the telephone through one of the dealers. An Order to buy is executed at the current market Ask Price and an Order to sell is executed at the current market Bid Price.</li>
                           <li>One Cancels the Other (“OCO”) – An Order that is linked to another Order. If one of the Orders is executed, the other will be automatically cancelled.</li>
                           <li>Stop Loss – A Stop Loss Order is an instruction to buy or sell a market at a price which is worse than the opening price of an open position (or worse than the prevailing price when applying the Stop Loss Order to an already open position). It can be used to help protect against losses. Please note that because of market gapping, the best available price that may be achieved could be materially different to the price set on the Stop Loss Order and as such, Stop Loss Orders are not guaranteed to take effect at the price for which they are set.</li>
                           <li>Trailing Stop – A Trailing Stop is the same as a Stop Loss Order with the only difference being that, instead of setting a price at which the Order is activated, the Trailing Stop Order is activated at a fixed distance from the market price. For example, if Customer has purchased a long open position and the market Ask Price increases, the Trailing Stop price will also increase and will trail behind the market Ask Price at the fixed distance set by Customer. If the market Ask Price then decreases, the Trailing Stop price will remain fixed at its last position and if the market Ask Price reaches the Trailing Stop price, the Order will be executed. Please note that because of market gapping, the best available price that may be achieved could be materially different to the price set on the Trailing Stop Order and as such, Trailing Stop Orders are not guaranteed to take effect at the fixed distance for which they are set.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Following submission of an Order, it is your sole responsibility to remain available for Order and Fill confirmations, and other communications regarding your Account until all open Orders are completed. Thereafter, you must monitor your Account frequently when you have Open Positions in the Account.</p>
                        <p>Your Order shall be valid in accordance with the type and time of the given Order, as specified. If the time of validity or expiration date/time of the order is not specified, it shall be valid for an indefinite period.</p>
                        <p>Kindly note that any specific instructions from you may prevent us from taking the steps that EM has designed and implemented in its execution policy as explained below to obtain the best possible result for the execution of your order/s in respect of the elements covered by your instructions.</p>

                     <li>
                        <p><strong>TERMS OF ACCEPTANCE FOR ORDERS</strong></p>
                        <p>It is your sole responsibility to clearly indicate the terms of an Order when entered, whether it is a Market Order, Limit Order, Stop Loss Order or any other type of Order, including the relevant price and lot size. You acknowledge and agree that, despite our best efforts, the price at which execution occurs may be materially different to the price specified in your Order. This may result from sudden price movements in the underlying assets that are beyond our control. EM shall have no liability for failure to execute Orders. EM shall have the right, but not the obligation, to reject any Order in whole or in part prior to execution, or to cancel any Order, where your Account contains Margin that is insufficient to support the entire Order or where such Order is illegal or otherwise improper.</p>

If your Account is a joint account, you agree that we are authorized to act on the instructions of any one person in whose name the Account is held, without further inquiry. We shall have no responsibility for further inquiry into such apparent authority and no liability for the consequences of any actions taken or failed to be taken by us in reliance on any such instructions or on the apparent authority of any such persons.</p>

                        <p>We shall use our reasonable endeavors to execute any order promptly, but in accepting your orders we do not represent or warrant that it will be possible to execute such order or that execution will be possible according to your instructions.

                        <p><strong>CONFIRMATIONS</strong></p>
                        <p>At the end of each trading day, confirmations for all Transactions that we have executed on your behalf on that trading day will be available via your online Account on our Website in the Open Positions window and Deal Blotter in the dealing console, which is updated online as each Transaction is executed. Confirmation of execution and statements of your Account(s), in the absence of manifest error, shall be deemed correct, conclusive and binding upon you if not objected to immediately by email if Orders were placed through EM’s Online Trading System or by telephone to the EM Trading Desk, within five Business Days of making such confirmations available to you via our Website or we notify you of an error in the confirmation within the same period.</p>
                        <p>In cases where the prevailing market represents prices different from the prices posted by EM, EM will attempt, on a best efforts basis and in good faith, to execute Market Orders on or close to the prevailing market prices.

                        <p>In the event that the MetaTrader5 or DXTrade client terminal is closed, Trailing Stop will not work.

                        <p>Payments from your Account require a withdrawal request form signed by all required Account holders and submitted in writing to us. If you request a withdrawal of monies from your Account and we cannot comply with it without closing some part of your open positions, we will not comply with the request until you have closed sufficient positions to allow you to make the withdrawal. Withdrawals will only be made on request by you, by bank transfer to an account in your name or by bankers draft payable to you personally or such other method as we, in our absolute discretion, may determine.</p>

                        <p>In cases of market movements which result in a negative balance in a client’s CFD Trading Account, EM Limited will execute one of the following mechanisms:</p>
                        <ul class="mt-4 mb-4 list-dotted">
                           <li>It will adjust the account balance to zero, thereby ensuring that the Client will not have to fund any negative balance and/or lose more money beyond the amount that the Client had allocated initially for CFD trading;</li>
                           <li>It will open a new trading account with a zero balance and close off the old account, without the client having to fund any negative balance and/or lose more money beyond the amount that the Client had allocated initially for CFD trading;</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>The negative balance protection outlined above is designed to counteract the occurrence of exceptional circumstances with the aim of providing client protection in case of extreme market events.</p>

                        <p>We may hold client money on your behalf outside the European Union. The legal and regulatory regime applying to any such bank or person will be different from the legal and regulatory regime in US and the European Union and in the event of the insolvency or any other analogous proceedings in relation to that bank or person, your money may be treated differently from the treatment which would apply if the money was held with a bank in an account in US and the European Union. We will not be liable for the insolvency, acts or omissions of any third party referred to in this clause.</p>

                        <p>You agree that we shall not be liable for any default of any counterparty, bank, custodian or other entity which holds money on your behalf or with or through whom transactions are conducted. You therefore take on the credit risk of the counterparty, bank, custodian or other entity. If the counterparty becomes insolvent, the counterparty may be unable to pay what it owes you on a CFD. In addition, you may not be able to recover any margin deposit which you placed with us and which we in turn place with the counterparty. We will of course do our best to help you recover any money which the counterparty owes you, but we are not personally liable to you for such amounts.</p>
                        <p>EM will not be liable for loss suffered by you in connection to your funds held by us, unless such loss directly arises from our gross negligence, willful default or fraud.</p>

You may be required to make further variable payments by way of margin against the purchase price of the investment, instead of paying (or receiving) the whole purchase (or sale) price immediately. The movement in the market price of your investment will affect the amount of margin payment you will be required to make.

                        <p>“Warning Threshold” is referring to the situation when the equity of the account reaches the level of the “Used Margin”.</p>
